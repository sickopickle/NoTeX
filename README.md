# NoTeX
Math handwriting conversion and solver

A React Native app that uses machine learning to convert handwritten mathematical expressions into LaTeX, then uses Nerdamer API to solve them. 
The app uses the @benjeau/react-native-draw package as a canvas, which depends on @luncheon/simplify-svg-path for converting points to Bezier curves used as input to machine learning model.
The react-native-mathjax package displays LaTeX outputs.


 The name NoTeX can be interpreted in two ways:

    1: No TeX. I personally hate writing LaTeX.

    2: Note-X. It can be used to take mathematical notes.
